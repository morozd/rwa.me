Together with <a href=\"http://www.sjoerdperfors.nl\">Sjoerd Perfors</a> I founded it in 2009 and in 2012 we transformed it into a profitable business together with Jaco de Vries of Omnext. Since January 2014 we have over 500.000 active users and our Flitsmeister apps can be downloaded on all the major platforms. Flitsmeister is the most well-known name in traffic in The Netherlands right now. The app was featured in Top Gear Magazine in 2010 and has been mentioned on almost all the dutch radio stations, websites and magazines.\n\t\t\t    </p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t    <div class=\"text-center\" style=\"margin-bottom:75px;\">\n\t      \n\t\t\t<img src=\"../assets/projects/flitsmeister-photo1.jpg\" />\n\n\t    </div>\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"large-12 columns\">\n\n\t\t\t    <h2>How it started</h2>\n\n\t\t\t    <p>\n\t\t\t      \tIn 2009, my colleague Sjoerd Perfors and I were frustrated that there were no traffic apps for The Netherlands that showed where there were speedtraps, traffic jams and speed cameras. So we decided to build one ourselves. After 6 months of designing and developing after our day job and during the weekends, we where finished with our first version. We decided we wanted to release it to the public and submitted it to the App Store in the beginning of 2010. What happened next was something we would have never expected. People started downloading the app and a few years later we reached half a million active users.\n\t\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"../assets/projects/flitsmeister-extras.png\" width=\"281\" style=\"float:right;margin-left:30px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 20px;\" />\n\n\t\t\t    <p>\n\t\t\t    \tTogether with Sjoerd Perfors, Jaco de Vries, Jorn de Vries, Ruben Meijering, Ruben Ernst and Nick Meessen we're working every day trying to improve our traffic service through our apps and website.

For those of you who are not yet familiar with the concept of Dropbox;\n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote class=\"quote\">Dropbox is a home for all your photos, docs, videos, and files. Anything you add to Dropbox will automatically show up on all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website — so you can access your stuff from anywhere.\n\t\t\t<div class=\"author\"><cite><a title=\"Dropbox - Tour\" href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/tour/1\">Dropbox - Tour</a></cite>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tI use Dropbox every day. It's the place where I store all my photos and sync them to/from my iPhone automatically, it's the service I use to sync files with clients, co-workers and friends. It's fast, reliable and best of all: very easy to use.\n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tFiles on Dropbox are private by default. As long as you don't give anyone access to your files or specific folders, no-one else can view or download them. \n\t\t      \t<br />\n\t\t\t\tOne of the great features of Dropbox is being able to share a file or folder with a public url, like this. You can, for example, use this feature to share a photo or any other image on Twitter where people can view it (even if they don't have a Dropbox account), or you can use it to quickly share a folder with a client without having to give them special permissions to sync the folder in their own Dropbox.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div class=\"row\">\n\n\t\t<div class=\"large-12 columns\">\n\n\t\t    <h2>The problem</h2>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tSharing a file through Dropbox is easy, but it's not a one step process. Let's say you want to share a .png file of a design you made with your followers on Twitter. You have to go to your Dropbox folder in Finder, place the file you want to share somewhere in your Dropbox folder, right-click it, click 'Share Dropbox-link' and then you're able to share the link with others. If sharing files is something you do on a daily basis, this process can be a bit devious.\n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tDropbox was not the only services that made file sharing possible. There were a couple of other services that focused on file sharing only. Those other services had apps that made sharing files more easy, but the downside was that if you already own a Dropbox account, you now had to pay again for that other service. This could be a waste of money for some people. \n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tAnother issue with services other than Dropbox is that your files are stored on their thirdparty server, which you might or might not trust. Dropbox on the other hand does everything they can possibly do to make sure your files are <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/27/en\">safe</a>.\n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"text-center\" style=\"background-color: #000000;margin-bottom:100px;\">\n      \n\t\t\t<img src=\"../assets/projects/dragshare2.png\" />\n\n    </div>\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"row\">\n\n\t\t<div class=\"large-12 columns\">\n\n\t\t    <h2>The solution</h2>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tWith all of the above in mind, I thought I'd save myself some time and money and create an app that had made sharing files through your existing Dropbox account really easy. \n\t\t\t\tOn a friday evening with a few beers and some music, Dragshare was born.\n\t\t\t\tThe result was a menu bar item app for your Mac, that can be used to drag files too which automatically turn into a Dropbox-link. When you drag a file to the menu bar icon, it puts the file in your Dropbox, creates the Dropbox-link that you can share and copies it your clipboard, all in a single step. Just drag & drop. \n\t\t\t\tNo need to pay for another service. None of your files stored on a server that you do not trust. Just fast and easy file sharing.\n\t\t    </p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      \n        <img src=\"../assets/projects/dragshare3.png\"  />\n\n    </div>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"row\">\n\n\t\t<div class=\"large-12 columns\">\n\n\t\t    <h2>Twitter, Facebook, Email, Custom Landing Pages...</h2>\n\n\t\t    <p>\n\t\t      \tA lot of people have different use cases when they are sharing files.

You can only play a sound that ignores the 'silent switch' of the iPhone if your app is running in the background. I hope Apple will give us access to setting an actual alarm in the future so third party alarm clock apps don't need to give the user a big set of instructions to set an alarm that will actually wake them in the morning..\n\t\t\t    </p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t</div>\n\n","role":"Idea, Design, Development","bottomStyle":"bottom-light","slug":"/work/alarmik","topStyle":"top-light","bgPrefix":"alarmik","client":"Personal","type":"iPhone App","published":true,"title":"Wake up in style"},"Date":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","Url":"/work/alarmik","Prefix":"work","Published":true,"FilePath":"/collections/work/alarmik.liquid"},"/collections/blog/the-secret-handshake.liquid":{"Meta":{"date":"2014-02-11T00:00:00Z","layout":"blog-post","body":"\n\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I stumbled upon a site called &#8216;The Secret Handshake&#8217;.
